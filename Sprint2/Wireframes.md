# **Wireframes**

For this task we needed to create a design template for the website we wanted to make which consist of the following pages which are the **HOME**, **COUNTRY**, **CITY** and **LANGUAGE** page.

## **Home Page**
To create the wireframe for the home page of the website, we decided to incorporate a navigation bar which is positioned at the top or header level of each page within the website. On the top left side of the navigation bar, there is a placeholder which represents either a logo or text which displays the name of the page that a user is currently on and re-directs them to the home page each time when clicked. There are also menus which can be clicked and they display each page of the website which when clicked on it will re-direct the user to the corresponding pages. For example, if a user selected the "Country" menu it will direct you to the country webpage which adds "/country" to the website's URL. On the top right area of the navigation bar, there is an interactive search bar that allows you to find certain content that is within the website.

Below the navigation bar there is an image placeholder which represents an image carousel or slideshow used to display images of certain countries, cities or landmarks. Below the carousel there is paragraph text which would be used to summarise the point of the website and contain certain information about certain countries. On the bottom of the website there would be an area labelled as a sitemap or footer which would allow a user to find clickable links which direct them to certain parts of the website to make navigation easier.

## **Country Page**
Inside the country page there is the navigation bar that is displayed for all the web pages and below it there is a header which would be called "Country List A-Z". Additionally, right next to the header there will be a filter icon where it would be possible to get a list of certain countries with similarities in certain ways such as listing countries which start with the same letters. Below the header there will be a full list of countries with different types of information about the country and flag images and this is is represented by the large placeholder. At the bottom of the page there will be a sitemap/footer which will remain in all the pages within the website.

## **City Page**
Inside the city page, a navigation bar was included as it is within all the web pages alongside the sitemap/footer containing the links that re-direct users to specific areas of the website to make facilitate website navigation. It would also contain a large header being "City List A-Z" and a filter icon which allows a user to find certain type of cities based on extra information such as highest or lowest population, descending or ascending orders. It would have a full list of cities with information related to the cities such as the population and this is represented by the large placeholder in the image.

## **Language Page**
For the language page, there would be the navigation bar at the top of the page and a sitemap/footer at the bottom of the page. It will also contain information about the three most spoken languages in the world where there are three images and captions which describe the rankings of the languages and some information related to the languages which could be the locations of where that language is mainly spoken in. The large place holder represents the list which will be added containing information about all the languages within all the countries around the world.
